1. Task achivement well decribe something , how much information you have included , how you selected information that you put in your writting , and write at least 150 words. 
2. Coherence and cohesion how well you organize your information , and how well it flows from beginning to end.

3. Lexical resource : this means vocabulary . This is how much vocabulary you use , and how varied , accurate and appropriate you are with vocabulary. Spelling errors will hurt your score , misusing word forms will hurt your score . If you say "sales increasing" , it's wrong . Itstead, you must say "sales increased". 
4. Grammatical range and accuracy : obviously this means "are you making grammar mistakes? ", and "are you using complex sentense structures? " if you're just doing the same structre over and over. "sale increased", then "sale fluctuated" and then "sales plummented". OK , your grammar is accurate , bu all you're giving me i s just past tense , past tense  and past tense. So you will get a good score for being accurate , but you will get a low score for using the same structure over and over.
